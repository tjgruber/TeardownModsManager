# TeardownModsManager
This script may be used to update, backup, and remove installed Teardown mods until until Steam Workshop availability in Teardown 0.6.

## How to use

### Via EXE:
The EXE is created using PS2EXE (PowerShell to EXE converter). Info about this is located here: https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE
  1. Download the .EXE
  2. Click .EXE to open.
  
### Via .PS1 script:
If you don't feel comfortable using the .exe, you may download the TeardownModsManager.ps1 PowerShell script and follow below instructions.
  1. Download the .ps1 file to desktop.
  2. Right-click on the .ps1 file, then click "Run wtih PowerShell".

## General
This is a work in progress, and not all mods will work due to mod names not being consistent between teardownmods.com, mod name in info.txt, mod folder name, .zip not being used, mod packages containing multiple mods, etc. If a mod does not work, create a GitHub issue to let me know, and I'll see about writing a static code workaround for that mod to get it to work!

  * All mods are checked against teardownmods.com
  * The sign-in button is not functional, but the idea behind it was ability to sign-in to the site allow you to do more. Likely, will not get to it before TD 0.6.
